The Key4hep project provides a complete turnkey software stack for detector optimisation and performance studies of future experiments.
The aim is to increase the posibilities of collaboration between the experiments - in the spirit of the [HSF](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org).

The design is based on the philosophy of providing a combination of multiple consistently inter-operating projects, 
which allow any experiment to either just start right away or to freely pick and choose from the set provided.

Multiple experiments decided to join and current project partners are [FCC](http://hep-fcc.github.io/FCCSW/), [CLIC](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CLIC/CLICSoftwareComputing), [ILC](https://ilcsoft.desy.de/portal), and [CEPC](http://cepcsoft.ihep.ac.cn). Supporting institutes are [CERN](https://home.cern) and [DESY](https://desy.de).

More information about the design philosophy you may find here, technical documentation here and a link to our meetings here.

Or a recipe for the impatient user.
